To run python files:
	1. Have some version of python 2 installed in your computer
	2. Type "python (filename)" in your terminal
total_infection.py:
	Total infection. Prints out the users in the system that get the virus given a test file and a start user.
limited_infection.py:
	Limited Infection. Takes in test file name and target number in input. Prints out
	the connected group of users that is smaller than the target number given. If the target number is larger than
	all connected group of users, it just prints the largest group out.
exact_infection.py:
	Takes in test file name and exact number wanted in input. Prints out failure if a connected group
	that is as large as the target number is not found. If successful, prints out the users that 
	should receive the new features.
Test Files:
	Format is as follows:
		coach
		student, student, student...
		coach
		student, student, student...
		...
	Two test files are given, and you can create your own test .txt files by following that format
	Assumptions:
		1. This format will be followed in test files
		2. There can only be one coach per class
		3. Coaches cannot also be students

Note: Some of my design choices, especially for data structures, may be questionable, but I have a good reason for doing 
	   it the way I did and would love to explain more over Skype.
